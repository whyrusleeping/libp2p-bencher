# Libp2p Bencher

> Benchmark Libp2p streams from go and JS implementations

## Usage

I've included a browser ready bundle (app.js). So just run main.go and it will automatically open in your default browser and the stream will open.

Note: js-libp2p-noise has an issue (Err: process is not defined) preventing it from running in browsers so I built it with a local copy.

Anyways, to build just run `node build.js`.
